## Code example

> Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
>For example:
>"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
>The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.

```
function DNAtoRNA(dna) {
  // create a function which returns an RNA sequence from the given DNA sequence
  let resulte = '';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < dna.length; i += 1) {
    let check = (dna[i] === 'T') ? resulte += 'U' : resulte += dna[i];
  }
  
  return resulte;
}
```
